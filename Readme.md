# A 2-Wheeled Robot

## Description:

#### This project is made for getting familiar with **[Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/)**. I have followed [The Construct](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6Lag-vv25fTX3e11mVY1Q)'s _Exploring ROS using a 2 Wheeled Robot_ series.

-   The basic 2-wheeled robot is made using ROS.
-   The structure is defined in Unified Robotic Description Format (URDF).
-   The simulation is run on RViz and Gazebo.

-   The robot was controlled using the [teleop_twist_keyboard](http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_keyboard) package. [Video](./visuals/3-KeyboardControl.mp4)
